## Direct Download

_build from source it is fun_

### [Download](https://github.com/Kushal-Chandar/C-Vector-Implementation-Library/releases)

### OR

## Build From Source 🔨

### Clone this Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Kushal-Chandar/C-Vector-Implementation-Library.git
```

### Run Cmake configuration

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -S .. -B .
```

### Build from build directory

> make sure your are in build directory, if you are getting errors

```sh
ninja
```

### Setup

**Run install.sh in the project root folder** <br>

> If you don't have git bash or have errors while running the install.sh. <br> Run the following commands in windows powershell.

```ps
mkdir c_vector
mkdir c_vector/lib
cp build/libc_vector.a c_vector/lib/
cp -r include c_vector
```

## Usage

Copy the contents in c_vector/include and c_vector/lib to a folder where your compiler searches for includes and directories. <br>
Example: <br>

- copy contents of **c_vector/include** to **path/to/mingw64/include**

- copy contents of **c_vector/lib** to **path/to/mingw64/lib**
  <br>

and Compile with

```sh
gcc file.c -lc_vector
```

OR

Compile with

```sh
gcc file.c -I"path to c_vector/include/c_implementations without quotes" -L"path to c_vector/lib/libc_vector.a without quotes" -lc_vector
```

lookup how to specify include directories for your compiler
